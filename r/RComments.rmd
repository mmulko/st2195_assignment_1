## One to Ten Printer R Comments

The task was to write R script that prints all integers between 1 and 10 *(including 1 and 10)* to screen. After some research of this programming language, I came up with **"for" cycle** which will print required integers. Here is my code:

```{r quote}
for (n in 1:10) {
  print(n)
}
```

**NOTE:** The range of needed integers is given with **":"** sign. Also, we can see that end of range *(10)* is included when printing integers. This will be important when reviewing Python script.
